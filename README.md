# EZStorage

Simple storage mod for Minecraft 1.7.10 (Forge).

## Description

EZStorage (alias Easy Storage) introduces an early-game storage system that scales and evolves as players progress. Want to put 100,000 Cobblestone in 1 slot? No problem. Blocks in the mod can add a crafting grid, additional storage, and more. Also includes NEI integration for 1-click crafting from the system's internal inventory!
 
## Blocks

- **Storage Core**
  - This is the core of your storage system
  - Click on this block to open the GUI (search box included), and add adjacent blocks to expand
  - Each system can only have 1 Storage Core
  - This block can only be broken if it contains no items
- **Storage Box**
  - Tier 1 storage add-on wich increases the storage capacity of the Storage Core by a small amount
- **Condensed Storage Box**
  - Tier 2 storage add-on
- **Hyper Storage Box**
  - Tier 3 storage add-on
- **Proxy Port**
  - Expose the storage inventory to hoppers, conduits or maschines
- **Crafting Box**
  - This adds a crafting grid to the GUI of your Storage Core (compatible with NEI + clicking for easy crafting from the internal inventory)

## Mod Integration

- **Not Enough Items** (GTNH version)
  - Overlay recipes
  - One-click crafting
  - Advanced tooltip overlay
  - NEI-like search
- **Waila**
  - Show storage content (items/types count) in world tooltip
- **JABBA**
  - Move the storage core from one place to another place using the dolly from Jabba
- **Crafting Tweaks**
  - Show typical crafting tweaks buttons on crafting grid
- **Et Futurum Requiem**
  - Spectator mode

## Remarks

This mod is intented to be a compact storage solution, and not an automated storage network. As of right now, I do not want to include any features like filtered output, network cables, external monitors, wireless access, or anything else remeniscent of Applied Energistics. Any issues created as requests for these features will be immediately closed.

## Contribution

If you want to help adding any feature or make improvements or getting compatibility with another mod, feel free to make a pull request. I only have the time to maintenance this mod at a low level, the lowest effort needed for getting it working nicely on my server and in the modpack.
